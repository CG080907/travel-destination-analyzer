6. Travel Destination Analyzer with Weather and Cost Forecast
Description: Build a tool that analyzes travel destinations for weather patterns, average costs, and best times to visit.
Use Case: Travelers can choose destinations based on preferences for weather and budget, optimizing their travel plans.
Python Instructions:
Data Collection: Use weather APIs (like OpenWeatherMap) and travel data from sources like Skyscanner.
Algorithm: Use data analysis techniques to forecast costs and weather trends.
GUI: Create an interactive map and dashboard showing recommended destinations, cost forecasts, and seasonal weather patterns using folium and Tkinter.
GitHub Collaboration:
Assign team members to data gathering, forecasting, and GUI development.
Each member should work on a branch (e.g., weather-analysis, destination-GUI).
Use code reviews and pull requests to integrate components.
